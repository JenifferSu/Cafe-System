# Cafe-System
This is my project that streamline the food order-taking process by connecting different types of users such as cafeteria vendor, customer, delivery man and administrator. Customers can use the application to place meal orders from the cafeteria by selecting items from the menus offered by different vendors. 
# Language Using
I'm using java to create the entire system. Kindly check out my file above to see how my program works.
